<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Rhythm Management Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pacemaker</li><li>ICD</li><li>BI-V ICD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiac Rhythm Management Devices (CRMDs) encompass three primary types: pacemakers, Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs), and Bi-Ventricular Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (Bi-V ICDs). Pacemakers regulate heartbeats for patients with bradycardia. ICDs monitor heart rhythms and deliver shocks to correct lethal arrhythmias. Bi-V ICDs provide advanced therapy for heart failure patients by coordinating the heart's chambers, improving efficiency. These devices are crucial in enhancing patient quality of life and preventing serious cardiac events.</p></p>
