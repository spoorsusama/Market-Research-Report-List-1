<p><strong>The Asthma Immunotherapies Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Subcutaneous Immunotherapy</li><li>Sublingual Immunotherapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Asthma immunotherapies include subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), both designed to reduce allergic responses. SCIT involves injecting allergens under the skin, stimulating the immune system to gradually tolerate the triggers. It typically requires visits to a healthcare provider and has a longer duration of treatment. Conversely, SLIT involves placing allergen tablets or drops under the tongue, allowing for easier self-administration and better patient compliance. Both methods aim to achieve long-term relief from asthma symptoms.</p></p>
