<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radial Forging Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Forging</li><li>Cold Forging</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radial forging machines operate through two primary methods: hot forging and cold forging. Hot forging involves heating metal to a plastic state, allowing for easier deformation and enhanced material properties, making it suitable for complex shapes and larger components. In contrast, cold forging takes place at room temperature, which retains the material's strength and dimensional accuracy while producing tighter tolerances. Both methods cater to distinct applications in industries such as automotive and aerospace, offering flexibility in design and manufacturing processes.</p></p>
